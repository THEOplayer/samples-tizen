# Minimal THEOplayer Smart TV example

Minimal THEOplayer Smart TV example is a barebone example of how to integrate THEOplayer in a Smart TV SDK.

For a more advanced example (with UI), check out the `example-with-ui` directory in the root directory of the project.

## Inserting your THEOplayer build

Place your THEOplayer build under `libs/`. Make sure to place a chromeless build (`THEOplayer.chromeless.js`). 
If you need to use HLS, make sure to also include the worker files.

## General Tizen set-up and launching the app

See README at the root level of the project.
